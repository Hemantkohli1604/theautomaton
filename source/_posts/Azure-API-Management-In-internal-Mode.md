I am working on a task to write Infrastructure as a Code (using ARM templates and PowerShell scripts) for creating resources in Azure. The infrastructure resembles the one mentioned in the following article: 

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-integrate-internal-vnet-appgateway 

Apart from creating ARM templates I created a PowerShell Script for creating resources as discussed in the microsoft documentation.
